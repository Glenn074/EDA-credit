# EDA-credit

📊 Credit Application EDA
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit application dataset to uncover insights into applicant profiles and factors influencing credit approval decisions. The analysis leverages Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and removed outliers.
Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Explored distributions and relationships of key financial and demographic features.
Correlation Analysis: Compared feature correlations separately for approved and refused applications using heatmaps.
Target Distribution: Visualized contract statuses (Approved, Refused, Canceled, Unused) using pie charts.
Group-wise Comparisons: Analyzed how features like AMT_ANNUITY and AMT_GOODS_PRICE vary across different contract outcomes.
Categorical Heatmaps: Highlighted how income types, client status, and industries relate to approval outcomes.

📌 Objectives
Understand applicant behavior and financial patterns.
Identify variables most correlated with approval decisions.
Build data intuition for potential predictive modeling.
